# Project_Fat_Spiderman_Report
#### **INITIAL IDEA / CONCEPT OF THE PROJECT**

The initial concept for this project was based on puzzle and physics gameplay. Early brainstorming had been influenced by puzzle games such as Portal and Inside. Our idea started focusing on the games physics and its possibilities for puzzle making and solving. 
Relying mostly on the physical interactions between assets the idea grew around the players ability to utilise certain objects to his advantage or disadvantage to complete the levels.

We were initially trying to achieve this by adding some special abilities to the playable character such as a grappling hook. The grapple would allow the player to reach for the required prop that would help him solve the puzzle or allow him to overcome an obstacle by swinging around specific parts in the level.

Our unique selling point was well-defined by the grappling hook and we soon began developing the game design around that feature. Following a group merge, the game started having more elaborate ideas being stirred into the pot and the team agreed in keeping the abilities simple and with a unique purpose. Eventually we decided to scrap the idea of being apple to pull objects towards you and instead came up with a weight-based system that would blend into the puzzle system by working in favour or against the players in the game.

The concept became known as the Fat Spiderman project, a first-person puzzle game where the players objective is to solve platformer puzzles to go from an area to the other. The puzzles are based on the swinging and on the weight of the player, who will have to exhibit good control of the characters abilities and movement to make it through the challenges.
The character’s main abilities were narrowed down to a set of two; a grappling hook that serves as a movement enhancer, allowing the player to swing over greater distances, and an ability to absorb and/or release items that would affect the character’s weight and consequently its movement abilities but also his strength. 


#### **TEAMWORK**

Having two programmers with previous game making experience, Sam and Mike took responsibility for creating the core game mechanics that we would be using for the game. This allowed our team to subdivide into two. We scheduled weekly meetings up so that we could assign our weekly tasks and discuss any ideas or problems that may have arisen. 

The teams kept each other updated with what they were doing at all times to avoid people overwritting eachother's work. Luckily for our team, Sam and Mike were always available to sort any problems that we may have encountered, or issues with the merging platform. In the end our team leaders found a good way to manage our resources and a good chemistry was evident in those that were most involved.

#### **ART & MODELLING**

While our programmers sorted the core mechanics of the game I began working on the level design as well as sketching out and modelling the most important assets for the game. 

#### **WEAPON MODEL**

The Fat Spiderman character was visualised owning a sort of ‘fat gun’ that would allow him to suck fat from nearby fat sources. The gun itself was inspired in vacuum cleaners, from old to contemporary, and the character would have to use both of his hands to carry it.
It would feature a grapple launcher under the main barrel from where it would shoot the grapple that would allow him to swing away.

As we developed the game we came up with the idea of implementing a visual cue that would further evidence the player getting fatter. To achieve such effect, we changed the weapons design so that the characters right arm would be more visible. 
This change led to a more open style weapon that wrapped up around the characters arm with a frame-like support, with a sort of prosthetic look. This visual cue would display the arm getting fatter and bigger as the player injected fat, or skinnier when shedding weight.
